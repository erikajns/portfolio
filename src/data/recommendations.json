Erika is well known for being someone with strong soft skills, communication skills, technical knowledge, and the ability to learn new things fast. I always believed she is a natural leader not only for her always good attitude but also for the ability to make good decisions even in difficult situations. With Erika, there is no company or team that can go wrong. Definetly she is someone I admire and highly recommend.",

Now with a few months in the same company and team, I have came to realize that none of that praise was wrong, it actually wasn't enough. She is just too good of a teammate and professional, but she's also growing non-stop, which is really impressive. I would trust her with any development or project management position, her responsibility and communication skills are admirable.",

During the several projects we've worked together she has always displayed leadership qualities and generated meaningful input that puts the project in position to succeed. She's very polite and reasonable which makes it a great person to work with. If your looking for someone with technical knowledge and leadership qualities I would 100% recommend Erika.",
